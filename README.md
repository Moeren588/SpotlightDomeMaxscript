# SpotlightDomeMaxscript
A simple tool that creates a colorfull spotlight dome

How to use it:
Drag the script into the max viewport or run it from the maxscript editor.
A small UI will open up allowing you to set segments and radius of the dome
Checking "Delete Dome" will delete the dome mesh after lights have been placed and set up.
When desired settings have been set, press "Create Light Dome"
A texture browser will open up to the script's location.

Light Intensity for all lights will now be controllable from the UI, or directly from one of the lights (instanced controller)
